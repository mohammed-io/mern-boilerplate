# MERN Boilerplate

### Getting Started

`yarn install`

In one tab, run:

`yarn server`

In another tab, run:

`yarn client`

The server is running on `:3000` and the client is running on `:8080`

### Todo
- Configure Webpack for different environments
- Refactor for React Router v4 (currently v3)
- Update any other module and refactor accordingly
- Last but not least... Add more stuff. Auth. AWS. Docker. RxJS. All the things.
